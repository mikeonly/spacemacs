# spacemacs
My Emacs configuration on top of [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). 

I used to keep it in a private repo on Bitbucket, but GitHub goodies tempted me to import it here. Probably, should have named this repo better, but I will leave it for later and open an issue for that.

Keep in mind that this is a game-repo. If anyone notices it, besides bringing endless shame on me, you are encouraged to suggest, correct or forget.

Thanks.
