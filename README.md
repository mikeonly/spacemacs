# spacemacs
My Emacs configuration on top of [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). 

I used to keep it in a private repo on Bitbucket, but GitHub goodies tempted me to import it here. Probably, should have named this repo better, but I will leave it for later and open an issue for that.

Keep in mind that this is a game-repo. If anyone notices it, besides bringing endless shame on me, you are encouraged to suggest, correct or forget.

I also found it quite useful to keep a list of improvements and bug fixes I want to make here, under Issues tab. It saves my time when I can delay a distraction of tweaking Emacs for later. Wishlist should help me working on one and only one task at once and keep my plan organised. Which is nice.

Thanks.
